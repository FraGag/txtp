# TXTP repository

This is a repository of [TXTP] files
for existing sets of music files
(using the original, unaltered file names).

The TXTP files in this repository
are [dedicated to the public domain][CC0].

Contributions are welcome!
However, if you author your own TXTP files,
please make sure that they're not Windows-specific
(i.e. that they will work on macOS and Linux too).
Concretely, this means that:

* file names must be treated as case-sensitive
  (i.e. copy the file name exactly, don't change uppercase letters to lowercase or vice versa)
* paths must use `/` as the directory separator, not `\`
